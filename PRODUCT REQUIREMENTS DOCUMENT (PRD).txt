PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)

1. Objective
Create a web application that allows fast vertical form-based data entry and converts it into a structured, multi-sheet Excel spreadsheet that can be downloaded by the user.

2. Core Concept
Input is optimized for humans (vertical form).
Output is optimized for systems (horizontal spreadsheet).

3. Functional Requirements

3.1 Input Form
- Single vertical column of fields
- Fixed field order
- Required field validation
- Keyboard navigation (Enter moves to next field)
- Submit action at the bottom

Fields:
- Serial Number
- Case Number
- Policy Number
- Claim Number
- Vehicle Number
- Court

- Title
- FIR Number
- Date of FIR
- Date of Accident

3.2 Dataset (Sheet) Management
- User can select an existing dataset or create a new one
- Each dataset represents one Excel sheet
- Dataset names must be unique
- Data is appended row by row

3.3 Data Processing Logic
- On submit, collect all field values
- Convert vertical data into a horizontal row
- Append to the selected dataset
- Preserve column order
- Do not modify existing records
- Clear input values after successful submission

3.4 Excel Export
- Single downloadable .xlsx file
- One worksheet per dataset
- Headers generated once per sheet
- Data written row-wise
- Compatible with Excel and Google Sheets

4. Logic Requirements

- Form submission is atomic (all-or-nothing)
- No partial writes
- Dataset creation is automatic if not found
- Form state and dataset state must stay in sync
- Export reflects current in-memory data exactly

5. Design Requirements

5.1 Layout
- Clean, minimal interface
- Vertical form layout
- Dataset selector placed above the form
- Submit button fixed at bottom

5.2 UX Rules
- No page reloads
- Clear error messages
- Visual confirmation on successful submission
- Fast form reset

5.3 Visual Style
- Neutral colors
- No heavy animations
- Readability over decoration
- Desktop-first, responsive by default

6. Tech Stack (Recommended)

Frontend:
- React (Vite)
- Plain CSS or Tailwind
- Controlled form components

Backend:
- Node.js
- Express.js

Excel Generation:
- exceljs

Data Storage:
- In-memory (initial version)
- Optional upgrade to database later

7. Tech Check (Validation)

- Can handle multiple datasets in parallel
- Can append unlimited rows
- Excel file structure is deterministic
- No data loss between submissions
- Exported file opens correctly in Excel

8. Out of Scope
- Authentication
- User roles
- External integrations
- Real-time collaboration

9. Success Criteria
- Users can enter data continuously without friction
- Excel output matches standard spreadsheet format
- Multiple datasets are preserved correctly
- System behaves predictably under repeated use
